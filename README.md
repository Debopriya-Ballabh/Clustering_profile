# Clustering_profile
The data analysis has been done using two different ordination methods (NMDS and PCoA). Each ordination has been calculated using two types of distances Bray-curtis and Jaccard. Here we have used three clustering methods like Heirarchial clustering, K-means clustering and K nearest neighbour clustering for each ordination methods used.
